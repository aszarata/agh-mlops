PROMPT: What's the best fish?
The "best" fish is subjective, as it can depend on many factors like personal preferences, cultural backgrounds, and local environmental conditions. What people might consider the most delicious or desirable fish also differs according to taste and regional culinary traditions.

That being said, some common favorites around the world in terms of both flavor intensity and nutritional content include cod (in areas where it's plentiful), shark, which is often thought of as one of the fattiest types due to its high oil quality and relatively low fat distribution on the fillets, sea bass with its firm flesh and mild flavors, tuna for especially rich and flavorful options like albacore, mahi-mahi for its sweet and slightly nutty taste with firm meat, and tilapia, which is often favored because it’s affordable yet nutritious.

Each of these fishes has its unique taste profiles, characteristics that make them well suited to prepare countless dishes from simple appetizers to complex meals. If you’re looking for a versatile fish that can easily be used in various culinary styles around the world, halibut could also be worth considering. It's firm and mild and fits well into almost any type of seafood preparation.

Of course, it’s always important to note that while these types are popular due to their qualities, there is plenty else out there too! Everyone can certainly have great adventures with a variety.
